2012/08/26 - Version 0.4.

-Added delete archive function. Set AWS Keys and Location/Vault, then insert Archive ID to delete.
-Saves preferences to "SAGU.properties" in launch folder and reloads settings on launch.
-Built with Java 1.6 libraries. Java 7 no longer required. 
-Set executable bit for Linux/OSX.
-Maintenance fix to logging. ArchiveID's logged under v0.2-0.3 contain an extra "Š" character at the beginning which was a rogue Java artifact. (SAGU will automatically handle this if entered, but users should remove the antecedent Š in early logs if using the archiveID with other utilities.)
